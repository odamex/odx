## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd c:\Users\Mike\projects\odx
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server (Angular + Electron):
```bash
npm start
```

This will:
1. Start Angular dev server on http://localhost:4200
2. Watch and compile Electron TypeScript
3. Launch Electron with hot reload

### Building

Build the Angular app and Electron:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Packaging

Package the application for distribution:

**Important**: Before packaging, you should set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to avoid GitHub API rate limits (60 requests/hour without token vs 5000 with token).

**All platforms:**
```bash
# With GitHub token (recommended)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here npm run package

# Without token (will work but with rate limits)
npm run package
```

**Specific platforms:**
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here npm run package:win    # Windows (ZIP)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here npm run package:mac    # macOS (DMG)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here npm run package:linux  # Linux (AppImage & DEB)
```

**For CI/CD**: Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a secret in your CI/CD pipeline:
- GitHub Actions: Add as repository secret and use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
- GitLab CI: Add as CI/CD variable
- Other CI: Follow your platform's secret management

**Getting a GitHub Token**:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate a new token (classic) with `public_repo` scope
3. Copy the token and use it in builds (never commit it to the repository)

## Configuration

### Electron Builder

electron-builder configuration is in `package.json` under the `build` key:

- **Windows**: NSIS installer with custom install directory option
- **macOS**: DMG with proper app signing (configure in build settings)
- **Linux**: AppImage and DEB packages

### Auto-Updates

Auto-updates are configured to use GitHub Releases. Set the repository in `package.json`:

```json
"build": {
  "publish": {
    "provider": "github",
    "owner": "odamex",
    "repo": "odx-launcher"
  }
}
```

## Architecture

### Electron Process Communication

- **Main Process** (`electron/main.ts`): Window management, system tray, auto-updates
- **Preload Script** (`electron/preload.ts`): Safe IPC bridge between main and renderer
- **Renderer Process** (Angular app): UI and application logic

### Angular Application

- **Standalone Components**: All components use the standalone API
- **Signals**: Reactive state management with @ngrx/signals
- **Router Animations**: Smooth transitions between views
- **Bootstrap 5**: Consistent UI with custom Odamex theming

### Key Services

**OdalPapi Service** - UDP master server communication for server list queries  
**File Manager** - Odamex installation detection, GitHub Releases integration, download management  
**IWAD Manager** - Automatic IWAD detection with Steam integration and WAD directory management  
**Local Network Discovery** - Subnet detection and UDP scanning for local servers not on the master list  
**Quick Match Service** - Client-side matchmaking with filtering, ranking, and monitoring  
**Updates Service** - Automatic launcher and game file updates via GitHub Releases  
**Notification Service** - Desktop notifications with system tray integration

## Development Notes

### Window Controls

The application uses a frameless window with custom title bar controls. The title bar is implemented in `src/app/core/title-bar/`.

### Navigation

The left sidebar navigation is implemented in `src/app/core/navigation/` with:
- Icon-based menu
- User profile at top
- Settings at bottom
- Active route highlighting

### Routing

All routes use lazy loading for optimal performance:
- `/home` - Dashboard with news and stats
- `/singleplayer` - Single player launcher
- `/multiplayer` - Quick Match for instant matchmaking
- `/servers` - Server browser
- `/hosting` - Local server management
- `/community` - Discord integration and links
- `/settings` - Application settings

### Quick Match System

The Quick Match feature provides automatic server selection based on player preferences:

**Filtering Criteria:**
- Maximum ping threshold (default: 100ms)
- Player count range (min/max)
- Preferred game types (DM, TDM, CTF, Coop, Survival, Horde)
- Available IWAD detection
- Excludes password-protected servers
- Optional filters for empty/full servers

**Ranking Algorithm:**
- Scores servers based on player count (prioritizes active games)
- Penalizes high ping for better connection quality
- Formula: `score = min(playerCount, 8) * 10 - (ping / 10)`

**Lightweight Monitoring Queue:**
- If no match is found immediately, users can enable background monitoring
- Checks for suitable servers every 30 seconds
- Runs for up to 10 minutes
- Desktop notifications when a match is found
- Integrated with system tray menu
- No central server dependency - all client-side

**Settings:**
- Fully customizable criteria in Settings → Quick Match
- Persisted in localStorage
- Game type multi-select
- Real-time criteria display on Quick Match page

### Local Network Discovery

Automatically discover Odamex servers running on your local network that may not be registered with the master server.

- Auto-detects private network subnets (10.x, 172.16.x, 192.168.x, 169.254.x)
- UDP scanning with Odamex LAUNCHER_CHALLENGE protocol
- Configurable port range (default: 10666-10675)
- Automatic refresh at customizable intervals (default: 60 seconds)
- Concurrent query throttling to prevent network flooding
- First-time confirmation dialog with network activity disclosure

**Configuration:**
- Enable/disable in Settings → Network
- Advanced settings panel:
  - Port range customization
  - Scan timeout (default: 200ms)
  - Refresh interval (default: 60s)
  - Max concurrent queries (default: 50)
- Manual "Scan Now" button for immediate discovery
- Displays detected network interfaces with CIDR notation

**UI Integration:**
- Local servers display with blue "Local" badge
- Always appear first in server list
- Server count shows: "Found X server(s) (Y local)"
- Works seamlessly alongside master server list
- Opt-in feature (disabled by default)
